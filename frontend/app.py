1. **Choose a Mode:** Use "Demo Mode" for a quick example, or "Manual Input" to enter your own values.
2. **Enter Details:** Input information like sales amount, discount, and shipping days.
3. **Click Predict:** See the predicted demand and a chart explaining the key factors.
4. **Understand the Results:** The chart shows why the prediction was made (e.g., "Discounts increased demand").
